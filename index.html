    <h1>Dr. Stephen Laurence Sutton: A Pioneer of Rainforest Canopy Research</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="memorial-note">This website serves as a memorial to my life's work. I, Dr. Stephen Laurence Sutton (1941-2024), passed away on December 31, 2024. My colleagues and family maintain this site to preserve my research and contributions to entomology and rainforest conservation.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout my career, I dedicated myself to studying rainforest canopy ecosystems and their remarkable insect biodiversity. As a graduate of Oxford University (MA, D.Phil.) and Fellow of both the Royal Entomological Society (F.R.E.S.) and Royal Geographical Society (F.R.G.S.), I committed my life to advancing our understanding of these complex and threatened environments. My research focused primarily on the intricate ecological relationships within tropical forest ecosystems, with particular emphasis on lepidopteran species that have been historically understudied.</p>
    
    <h2>Career and Scientific Contributions</h2>
    
    <p>My scientific career spanned over six decades, beginning with early work on entomology in Britain and expeditions to the South Caspian, evolving into pioneering research on rainforest canopy ecosystems in Southeast Asia. I developed innovative methodologies for studying canopy insect communities and contributed significantly to our understanding of tropical biodiversity, particularly in Borneo. Throughout my work, I maintained a commitment to both rigorous science and practical conservation applications.</p>
    
    <h3>The Kinabalu Birdwing Butterfly Project</h3>
    <p>The <em>Troides andromache</em>, or Kinabalu Birdwing, became a passion of mine in my later years. This rare and endangered butterfly is truly magnificent, with the female boasting an impressive wingspan of 185 mm, approximately the size of a small dinner plate. It is endemic to Borneo with its stronghold on Mt. Kinabalu (4,095 meters) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and serves as the official state butterfly of Sabah.</p>
    
    <p>From 2018 until my passing, I led a dedicated conservation team working to assess extinction risk for this majestic creature, implement measures to bolster its population, and create sustainable conservation models through ecotourism. Our holistic approach integrated rigorous scientific research with practical conservation strategies and community engagement, reflecting my belief that effective conservation must address both ecological and socioeconomic factors.</p>
    
    <p>Our work culminated in a significant achievement when on September 13, 2023, the Sabah State Cabinet officially declared the Kinabalu Birdwing (<em>Troides andromache</em>) as the State Butterfly of Sabah. As <a href="https://www.theborneopost.com/2023/10/02/sabah-unveils-unique-and-endemic-state-butterfly/">reported by The Borneo Post</a>, the unveiling ceremony on October 2, 2023, was presided over by Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Christina Liew, who formally named it "Kalibambang Emas" in the local ethnic language, signifying "a large and vividly coloured butterfly." At the ceremony, I was honored to be acknowledged as "the leading researcher of the Kinabalu Birdwing Project," having "played an important role in getting the above butterfly known." This designation not only recognized our conservation efforts but also established a new tourism icon for Sabah while highlighting the region's status as a hub of insect megadiversity.</p>
    
    <p>Our work received generous support from the Rotary Club of Kota Kinabalu, the Ministry of Tourism Sabah, and the Hyatt Regency Hotel Kota Kinabalu. These collaborative relationships allowed us to expand our research scope and implement conservation initiatives that would have been impossible without institutional support.</p>
    
    <p>We collaborated with homestay operators in Kg Kiau at the foothills of Mt. Kinabalu, helping them cultivate host plants essential for the butterfly's caterpillars. This initiative attracted paying visitors eager to photograph these free-flying giants in their natural habitat, creating sustainable income for local communities. I found this integration of conservation science with community development particularly rewarding, as it demonstrated how scientific knowledge could directly benefit both endangered species and human communities.</p>
    
    <p>Internationally classified as rare and endangered in 1987, we began reassessing its conservation status following a request from the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) via the Swallowtail and Birdwing Butterfly Trust of London. The butterfly is currently categorized as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red Data List and is a protected animal under Part I of Schedule 2 of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. Following our advocacy, the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Environment has considered upgrading its protection status to "Totally Protected Species" in Schedule 1. This ongoing work represents a critical contribution to global understanding of lepidopteran conservation status and methodology, and I hope my colleagues will continue this vital research.</p>
    
    <h3>Pyraloid Moths of Borneo</h3>
    <p>Since 2009, I collaborated with three dedicated researchers—Dato' Henry Barlow, Lim Kooi Fong, and Dr. Terry Whitaker—to compile a comprehensive guide to the Pyraloid Moths of Borneo. This ambitious project documented approximately 2,000 species found in Borneo, many previously undescribed in scientific literature. The taxonomic work required meticulous examination of morphological characteristics, genetic analysis, and ecological observation—often in challenging field conditions.</p>
    
    <p>We published multiple volumes for species identification, including <a href="https://www.nhpborneo.com/book/a-preliminary-guide-to-pyralid-moths-of-borneo/">Volume 1 (focusing on Pyralidae and Thyridoidea)</a> and <a href="https://www.nhpborneo.com/book/a-preliminary-guide-to-pyraloid-moths-of-borneo-part-2/">Volume 2 (addressing Crambidae Part 1)</a>. Recognizing the importance of accessibility in scientific communication, we established complementary online resources to supplement our published volumes. This forward-thinking approach to dissemination ensured that our research findings reached the broadest possible audience of scientists, students, and conservation practitioners.</p>
    
    <p>The project will continue through my colleagues, with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Mally">Dr. Richard Mally</a> joining as lead author for Volume 3 (Crambidae Part 2). I take great satisfaction in knowing that this work will outlive me, providing a foundation for future entomological research in the region. The documentation of these often-overlooked species represents one of my most significant contributions to biodiversity science in Southeast Asia.</p>
        
    <h2>Borneo Books: A Literary Journey</h2>
    <p>From 1999 to 2014, my wife Rosalind and I operated Borneo Books, a specialized bookstore in Kota Kinabalu. What began as a small shop in the Wisma Merdeka focusing on Borneo literature grew into a cultural hub for both locals and visitors. This enterprise represented my commitment to knowledge dissemination beyond traditional academic channels.</p>
    
    <p>At our peak, we expanded to four locations, including a second-hand bookshop designed to resemble a traditional wood-paneled establishment from London's Charing Cross Road. We created a welcoming space with seating areas and complimentary coffee, fostering lively discussions among book lovers and researchers. These conversations often led to unexpected collaborations and research insights that informed my scientific work.</p>
    
    <p>The bookstore specialized in regional literature, particularly works on Borneo's history and natural environment. We maintained strong relationships with local publishers like Natural History Publications (NHP) and supplied textbooks to organizations such as University Malaysia Sabah, the Sabah Forestry Department, and the Southeast Asia Rainforest Research Programme.</p>
    
    <p>A combination of factors—the 2008 financial crisis, increasing competition from online retailers, rising operational costs, and changing consumer habits—led to the closure of our final location on December 31, 2013. Despite this ending, the bookstore played a vital role in Sabah's intellectual life for nearly 15 years, connecting people with knowledge about Borneo's unique environment and culture. I reflected on this experience in my article "The Decline &amp; Fall of a Small Book Business," examining the challenges facing specialized scientific publishing and knowledge dissemination in the digital age.</p>

    <h2>Obituaries and Remembrances</h2>
    <p>My passing on December 31, 2024, was marked by tributes from colleagues and institutions worldwide. The Royal Entomological Society published an obituary highlighting my contributions to tropical forest ecology and canopy research methodologies. The University of Leeds, where I spent much of my academic career, established the Stephen L. Sutton Memorial Fund to support early-career researchers in tropical entomology, particularly those from Southeast Asian nations.</p>
    
    <p>The Sabah Society, with which I maintained a close relationship for over three decades, dedicated a special issue of their journal to my work on Bornean lepidoptera. This publication included personal reflections from colleagues and former students, emphasizing not only my scientific contributions but also my mentorship and advocacy for conservation.</p>
    
    <p>Perhaps most meaningfully, the community of Kg Kiau near Mt. Kinabalu held a traditional memorial ceremony honoring my work with the Kinabalu Birdwing Project. Local leaders spoke of how our collaborative conservation efforts had created sustainable economic opportunities while protecting their natural heritage. This recognition from the community with whom I worked so closely in my final years represents the fulfillment of my belief that effective conservation must benefit both ecosystems and the people who depend on them.</p>
